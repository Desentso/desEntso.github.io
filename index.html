        <h3 class="descTitle">Overview</h3>
        <p class="desc"><a class="link" href="https://ruoanhinta.fi/?lang=en">Ruoanhinta.fi</a> is a webapp that 
          anyone can use to compare the prices of grocery stores, and ultimately find the cheapest store.
          <br /><br />
          The front-end was built using React, Redux and Redux-saga. It's a SPA, responsive and user-friendly. 
          The main part of the application is fairly simple search and select kind of view.
          The front-end also has a cool map view, where the user can easily see the closests stores and their prices.
          It also helps to discover new stores which you might not realize exist or search for. 
          There is also a view to see historical prices, and compare stores between each other, over different periods of time.

          <br /><br />

          The back-end is a NodeJS/ExpressJS app, that exposes API endpoints that the front-end uses to query the data.
          Redis is used to cache requests for everything between an hour (prices) to couple days (stores). As some data can change
          often e.g. the prices of products, but something like stores and their locations hardly ever change. Caching both
          reduces the load on external servers, and also makes the responses much faster. InfluxDB
          is used to store historical prices and other time-series statistics. InfluxDB is specially developed to store time-series data,
          such as price changes over time. It makes querying that data much faster than typical databases (e.g. Postgresql). 
          Historical data is also fun to look at, but it also has research and market/financial analysis use cases.
          
          <br /><br />

          I learned a lot new about time-series data and how to store it optimately. Also learned more about how to make servers
          more performant. In this specific case using caching was a great choice. Also utilizing the existing time-series data for
          queries helped making responses faster.

        <br />
        <h3 class="descTitle">Challenges</h3>
        <p class="desc">InfluxDB was totally new for me, so learning it properly took some time. It was very rewarding
          experience though, and helped to speed up the app a lot. The map view was a bit problematic, if the user zooms out a lot
          the app will query and render all the stores in that area, so if there a thousands of stores rendering will take some time and
          slow down rest of the UI. To solve that the rendering should maybe happen in a web worker or something, but implementing that is still
          work in progress.

          hire taskers to do any kinds of tasks on ad-hoc basis. It makes hiring people for small tasks easier by
          connecting taskers and businesses or households that are looking to get small tasks done. For example features
          include complete account creation flow, adding a task, browsing tasks, commenting, quoting, review system,
          profile system, private messages, escrow payments. It's fully functional except the Stripe payments are in
          test mode.
          <br /><br />
          Duunli webapp was build using JavaScript. It has a SPA React front-end and runs NodeJS with ExpressJS
          framework on server-side. The server has REST API which is used to communicate between the front-end and
          server. As a database I used Postgresql, which I think is a really solid tool. This was my first full scale
          React app, and it really made me fall in love with React. It just makes your life so much easier.
          <br /><br />
          I learned a lot while developing Duunli. Everything from design to back-end was done single-handedly by me.
          For example how to structure a big project, how to use React in big projects. Got a lot more comfortable with
          my React skills and really like it as a tool a lot.

        <h3 class="descTitle">Challenges</h3>
        <p class="desc">This was my first big React app. If I started it now I would definitely use a store like Redux,
          it would help a lot in state managing and make the code easier to read. Other improvements for cleaner code
          could be made by creating even more generic/reusable components and organizing those better. There was also
          challenges on how to design the business logic, which turned out to be more complex than I had thought. There
          is always something that could be done better, but the app works and is finished, overall I'm really satisfied
          on how it turned out.</p>

          I have been interested in blockchain and cryptocurrencies for couple of years. I always thought that I knew

          looking for times with time zone information. The time zone bot then calculates how many hours and minutes
          until the time happens and posts this to the Reddit. It also uses the <a href="#countle"
            class="link">Countle</a> API to create a countdown.
          <br />
          <br />
          The Time zone Bot uses the Reddit API to get new posts and comments. First it filters the posts by e.g too
          long, posted by another bot. After that it uses regex to find common time formats with time zone info. Then it
          tries to determine the tense of the comment/post and search for dates and keywords, to make sure that the time
          happens in the future/present and not in the past. If everything passes the bot sends the comment.

          <br /><br />
          The time zone bot has got very positive feedback from the users on Reddit. <i>"Best bot on Reddit! Thank you
            so much", "This is my favourite bot", "This bot needs to appear on every thread", "a useful bot, I like

        <h3 class="descTitle right">Overview</h3>
        <p class="desc right">I developed this program with Python while working in the Finnish Defence Forces. The
          program helped at controlling the dozens of computers we had in our classrooms. With the program we could for
          example update all the computers, send files/folders, start specific programs and connect the computers to a
          server or start a server and only connect some computers. The program saved a lot of time, because we could
          control the computers simultaneously and remotely. Also if something went wrong during training we could just
          use the remote control and solve the problems faster.
          <br /><br />
          The program is easy to use as it has a clear and intuitive GUI. I developed the program using Python and the
          underlying networking is done with sockets. The program can do pretty much anything, it even supports start up
          with Wake on LAN. Because the "backbone" of the program is stable and the client program supports remote
          updating, it's easy to add new functionalities. There haven't been any use case that couldn't have been
          implemented.</p>

        <h3 class="descTitle right">Challenges</h3>
        <p class="desc right">I learned a lot about sockets and networking in general. Getting the program to start up
          and login to Windows was difficult, but was able to solve this by starting the program with windows task
          scheduler. That would start the program behind when the computer was started up. This way I could issue
          commands to it, but not yet login. To login I had to issue a command that removed the password and then
          restart the computer. Then the computer would login straight to windows as it has no password, and the program
          would change the password back.</p>

        <p class="desc right">The game is created with pure Javascript. It is inspired by a popular mobile game called
          "BBTAN". The game is never-ending. Your goal is to clear the boxes and not let them hit the bottom. The boxes
          have hit points, when you hit a box with a ball the hit points go down by one, the box disappears when its hit
          points go to zero. You start with one ball, but can get more balls by hitting the little balls with a plus
          sign. When all balls have exited through the bottom a new round starts. At the start of a new round, a new row
          of boxes appears. As the game goes on the new round of boxes gets more hit points. You score a point when you
          survive one round.

        <p class="desc right">The game works just like any other Blackjack game. It allows betting. The game uses 4
          decks and shows unique cards.
          <br /><br />
          It's coded with Java and uses object-oriented programming.
          You can find the code from Github: <a class="link"

        <h3 class="descTitle right">Challenges</h3>
        <p class="desc right">First time I created a game with Java so getting everything right was challenging. Making
          the GUI was maybe the most challenging part, also the game flow and displaying all the right information to
          player.</p>
