      <h3 class="descTitle">Overview</h3>
      <p class="desc"><a class="link" href="https://www.duunli.com">Duunli.com</a> is a website that anyone can use to hire taskers to do any kinds of tasks on ad-hoc basis. It makes hiring people for small tasks easier by connecting taskers and businesses or households that are looking to get small tasks done. For example features include complete account creation flow, adding a task, browsing tasks, commenting, quoting, review system, profile system, private messages, escrow payments. It's fully functional except the Stripe payments are in test mode.
        <br/><br/>
        Duunli webapp was build using JavaScript. It has a SPA React front-end and runs NodeJS with ExpressJS framework on server-side. The server has REST API which is used to communicate between the front-end and server. As a database I used Postgresql, which I think is a really solid tool. This was my first full scale React app, and it really made me fall in love with React. It just makes your life so much easier.
        <br/><br/>
        I learned a lot while developing Duunli. Everything from design to back-end was done single-handedly by me. For example how to structure a big project, how to use React in big projects. Got a lot more comfortable with my React skills and really like it as a tool a lot.
        <br/><br/>

      <h3 class="descTitle">Challenges</h3>
      <p class="desc">This was my first big React app. If I started it now I would definitely use a store like Redux, it would help a lot in state managing and make the code easier to read. Other improvements for cleaner code could be made by creating even more generic/reusable components and organizing those better. There was also challenges on how to design the business logic, which turned out to be more complex than I had thought. There is always something that could be done better, but the app works and is finished, overall I'm really satisfied on how it turned out.</p>

        I also built a React UI for the wallet, block explorer, and a simple control panel.
        <br/><br/>
        I have been interested in blockchain and cryptocurrencies for couple of years. I always thought that I knew what blockchain is and how it works. But when diving deeper into it and implementing it myself, I realised I didn't really know how it works. Now I can say with confidence that I understand how some parts of it work.

      <p class="desc">The Time zone bot is a bot that automatically searches for posts and comments in the Reddit looking for times with time zone information. The time zone bot then calculates how many hours and minutes until the time happens and posts this to the Reddit. It also uses the <a href="#countle" class="link">Countle</a> API to create a countdown.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Time zone Bot uses the Reddit API to get new posts and comments. First it filters the posts by e.g too long, posted by another bot. After that it uses regex to find common time formats with time zone info. Then it tries to determine the tense of the comment/post and search for dates and keywords, to make sure that the time happens in the future/present and not in the past. If everything passes the bot sends the comment.

        <br/><br/>
        The time zone bot has got very positive feedback from the users on Reddit. <i>"Best bot on Reddit! Thank you so much", "This is my favourite bot", "This bot needs to appear on every thread", "a useful bot, I like this"</i>

      <h3 class="descTitle right">Overview</h3>
      <p class="desc right">I developed this program with Python while working in the Finnish Defence Forces. The program helped at controlling the dozens of computers we had in our classrooms. With the program we could for example update all the computers, send files/folders, start specific programs and connect the computers to a server or start a server and only connect some computers. The program saved a lot of time, because we could control the computers simultaneously and remotely. Also if something went wrong during training we could just use the remote control and solve the problems faster. 
      <br/><br/>
      The program is easy to use as it has a clear and intuitive GUI. I developed the program using Python and the underlying networking is done with sockets. The program can do pretty much anything, it even supports start up with Wake on LAN. Because the "backbone" of the program is stable and the client program supports remote updating, it's easy to add new functionalities. There haven't been any use case that couldn't have been implemented.</p>

      <h3 class="descTitle right">Challenges</h3>
      <p class="desc right">I learned a lot about sockets and networking in general. Getting the program to start up and login to Windows was difficult, but was able to solve this by starting the program with windows task scheduler. That would start the program behind when the computer was started up. This way I could issue commands to it, but not yet login. To login I had to issue a command that removed the password and then restart the computer. Then the computer would login straight to windows as it has no password, and the program would change the password back.</p>

      <p class="desc right">The game is created with pure Javascript. It is inspired by a popular mobile game called "BBTAN". The game is never-ending. Your goal is to clear the boxes and not let them hit the bottom. The boxes have hit points, when you hit a box with a ball the hit points go down by one, the box disappears when its hit points go to zero. You start with one ball, but can get more balls by hitting the little balls with a plus sign. When all balls have exited through the bottom a new round starts. At the start of a new round, a new row of boxes appears. As the game goes on the new round of boxes gets more hit points. You score a point when you survive one round.

If you were the first one looking for group, you will be the first one to get matched.

        The app uses web sockets, socket.io as a framework. Sockets in this case reduces server-load and makes the user experience smoother and faster.
